Feature: US4a - Auto-generate entries from MD ref
As a lender I need charge information to be generated in line with my pre-approved charge so that I can efficiently draw up charge documents and know that entries will properly reflect my interest (capture MD template info only)

Acceptance Criteria
MD details match MDref/CRE and Role Code information
MDref with Charge and Chargee only

Scenario: Generate template charge entries from an MD reference with only charge and chargee information

Given that there is an MD reference with charge and chargee information
When a case is submitted which includes the given MD reference
Then a charge entry template is generated
And a chargee entry template is generated
